	doi = {10.2337/dc06-2544},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}—At birth, the lifetime risk of developing diabetes is one in three, but lifetime risks across {BMI} categories are unknown. We estimated {BMI}-specific lifetime diabetes risk in the U.S. for age-, sex-, and ethnicity-specific subgroups. 
            {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}—National Health Interview Survey data (n = 780,694, 1997–2004) were used to estimate age-, race-, sex-, and {BMI}-specific prevalence and incidence of diabetes in 2004. U.S. Census Bureau age-, race-, and sex-specific population and mortality rate estimates for 2004 were combined with two previous studies of mortality to estimate diabetes- and {BMI}-specific mortality rates. These estimates were used in a Markov model to project lifetime risk of diagnosed diabetes by baseline age, race, sex, and {BMI}. 
            {RESULTS}—Lifetime diabetes risk at 18 years of age increased from 7.6 to 70.3\% between underweight and very obese men and from 12.2 to 74.4\% for women. The lifetime risk difference was lower at older ages. At 65 years of age, compared with normal-weight male subjects, lifetime risk differences (percent) increased from 3.7 to 23.9 percentage points between overweight and very obese men and from 8.7 to 26.7 percentage points for women. The impact of {BMI} on diabetes duration also decreased with age. 
            {CONCLUSIONS}—Overweight and especially obesity, particularly at younger ages, substantially increases lifetime risk of diagnosed diabetes, while their impact on diabetes risk, life expectancy, and diabetes duration diminishes with age.},

	abstract = {Body mass index or {BMI} is a statistical index using a person's weight and height to provide an estimate of body fat in males and females of any age. It is calculated by taking a person's weight, in kilograms, divided by their height, in meters squared, or {BMI} = weight (in kg)/ height{\textasciicircum}2 (in m{\textasciicircum}2). The number generated from this equation is then the individual's {BMI} number. The National Institute of Health ({NIH}) now uses {BMI} to define a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese instead of traditional height vs. weight charts. These classifications for {BMI} are in use by the {NIH} and the World Health Organization ({WHO}) for White, Hispanic, and Black individuals. The cutoffs underestimate the obesity risk in the Asian and South Asian populations, so their classification has slight alterations. The {BMI} number and classifications are listed below.[1][2] However, individual variations do exist, and {BMI} is insufficient as the sole means of classifying a person as obese or malnourished. In certain populations, like elite athletes and body-builders, an elevated {BMI} does not directly correlate to their health status due to their increased muscle mass and weight falsely increasing their {BMI}. Moreover, in the pediatric population, {BMI} allows comparison between children of the same sex and age. For children, a {BMI} that is less than the fifth percentile is underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered obese.[3]},

              To examine determinants of racial/ethnic differences in diabetes incidence among postmenopausal women participating in the Women’s Health Initiative. 
             
             
              {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} 
              Data on race/ethnicity, baseline diabetes prevalence, and incident diabetes were obtained from 158,833 women recruited from 1993–1998 and followed through August 2009. The relationship between race/ethnicity, other potential risk factors, and the risk of incident diabetes was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models from which hazard ratios ({HRs}) and 95\% {CIs} were computed. 
             
             
              {RESULTS} 
              Participants were aged 63 years on average at baseline. The racial/ethnic distribution was 84.1\% non-Hispanic white, 9.2\% non-Hispanic black, 4.1\% Hispanic, and 2.6\% Asian. After an average of 10.4 years of follow-up, compared with whites and adjusting for potential confounders, the {HRs} for incident diabetes were 1.55 for blacks (95\% {CI} 1.47–1.63), 1.67 for Hispanics (1.54–1.81), and 1.86 for Asians (1.68–2.06). Whites, blacks, and Hispanics with all factors (i.e., weight, physical activity, dietary quality, and smoking) in the low-risk category had 60, 69, and 63\% lower risk for incident diabetes. Although contributions of different risk factors varied slightly by race/ethnicity, most findings were similar across groups, and women who had both a healthy weight and were in the highest tertile of physical activity had less than one-third the risk of diabetes compared with obese and inactive women. 
             
             
              {CONCLUSIONS} 
              Despite large racial/ethnic differences in diabetes incidence, most variability could be attributed to lifestyle factors. Our findings show that the majority of diabetes cases are preventable, and risk reduction strategies can be effectively applied to all racial/ethnic groups.},

Methods Participants include 23,992 women with {HbA}1c levels {\textless}6\% and no {CVD} or diabetes at baseline followed from February 1993 to March 2007. {SES} was measured by education and income while diabetes was self-reported. Results Over 12.3 years of follow-up, 1,262 women developed diabetes. In age and race adjusted models, the relative risk of diabetes decreased with increasing education ({\textless}2 years of nursing, 2 to {\textless}4 years of nursing, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate: 1.0, 0.7 [95\% Confidence Interval ({CI}), 0.6–0.8], 0.6 (95\% {CI}, 0.5–0.7), 0.5 (95\% {CI}, 0.4–0.6), 0.4 (95\% {CI}, 0.3–0.5); ptrend{\textless}0.001). Adjustment for traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors attenuated this relationship (education: ptrend = 0.96). Similar associations were observed between income categories and diabetes. Conclusion Advanced education and increasing income were both inversely associated with incident diabetes even in this relatively well-educated cohort. This relationship was largely explained by behavioral factors, particularly body mass index.},

Despite having access to above average social and economic resources, nonpoor African Americans and Latinos report significantly worse health compared to nonpoor Whites. We combine data from the parents and children of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79) to address two specific research aims. First, we generate longitudinal {SES} trajectories over a 33-year period to estimate the extent to which socioeconomic mobility is associated with exposure to discrimination (acute and chronic) across different racial/ethnic groups ({nonHispanic} Whites, {nonHispanic} Blacks, and Hispanics). Then we determine if the disparate relationship between {SES} and self-rated health across these groups can be accounted for by more frequent exposure to unfair treatment. For Whites, moderate income gains over time result in significantly less exposure to both acute and chronic discrimination. Upwardly mobile African Americans and Hispanics, however, were significantly more likely to experience acute and chronic discrimination, respectively, than their socioeconomically stable counterparts. We also find that differential exposure to unfair treatment explains a substantial proportion of the Black/White, but not the Hispanic/White, gap in self-rated health among this nationally representative sample of upwardly mobile young adults. The current study adds to the debate that the shape of the {SES}/health gradient differs, in important ways, across race and provides empirical support for the diminishing health returns hypothesis for racial/ethnic minorities.},

A comprehensive understanding of the patterning of racial disparities indicates that racism in both its institutional and individual forms remains an important determinant. There is an urgent need to build the science base that would identify how to trigger the conditions that would facilitate needed societal change and to identify the optimal interventions that would confront and dismantle the societal conditions that create and sustain health inequalities.},

Efforts should be focused to understand the impact of socioeconomic conditions on the health and quality of care of women with diabetes.},
