# SWAN-Project

A personal research project on survival analysis for incidence of diabetes in middle-aged women.

The primary covariate of interest is health insurance status, with additional covariates including race and household income at baseline as an indicator for socioeconomic status

The data come from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation which studied a cohort of middle-aged women from 1998 to 2008 and included a baseline survey and 10 follow-up surveys.

This project is in progress, updates over the course of the research.
